Getting Started with Digital Humans
This page will help you get started with Ex-Human API

Ex-Human API
Ex-Human is a Digital Human Platform that allows anyone to create interactive AI Humans supporting hyper-realistic conversations. This API provides developers with access to a wide range of tools and features for building interactive AI Humans.

Authentication
First, create a Bearer token at https://admin.exh.ai/. To authenticate your requests, include the Bearer token in the Authorization header of your HTTP requests. The header should have the following format: Authorization: Bearer <your-token>.

Chatbot Services
We offer two services for language interaction:

get_response returns the response from the bot to the user message within a dialog
get_smart_replies returns several suggested responses for user to continue the conversation
Both services require a dialog context. You can also pass persona facts and bot name to customize your Digital Human.

Talking Heads Services
We also offer two services for generating videos of AI Humans:

create_bot takes a photo as input and returns a link to a video with an animated AI Human, which is called idle_url
generate_lipsync takes idle_url, text and voice as input, and generates a lip-synced video of an AI Human speaking the text. The default character limit per request is 200. Please contact us at support@exh.ai to request an increase
